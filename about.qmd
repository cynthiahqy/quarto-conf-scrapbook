## Conference Description

> For posit::conf(2023), we have an array of workshops that will feature hands-on exercises, discussions, and Q&A. You can meet, share and collaborate with other conference attendees with similar interests. This year, for the first time, weâ€™re offering a mix of one and two-day workshops so that with your two-day workshop pass, you can choose to go deep into a single topic or spread your time across two topics.
>
> Four conference tracks highlight the exciting work being done across the R, PyData, & Posit landscape in two jam-packed days. Hear from some of the most thoughtful practitioners and effective speakers in science, industry, and technology.
