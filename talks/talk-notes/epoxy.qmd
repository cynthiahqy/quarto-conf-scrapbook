title: "epoxy: Super Glue for Data-driven Reports and Shiny Apps"
author: Garrick Aden-Buie
abstract: |
    R Markdown, Quarto, and Shiny are powerful frameworks that allow authors to create data-driven reports and apps. But truly excellent reports require a lot of work in the final steps to get numerical and stylistic formatting just right. 
    
    {epoxy} is a new package that uses {glue} to give authors templating superpowers. Epoxy works in R Markdown and Quarto, in markdown, LaTeX, and HTML outputs. It also provides easy templating for Shiny apps for dynamic data-driven reporting. 

    Beyond epoxy's features, this talk will also touch on tips and approaches for data-driven reporting that will be useful to a wide audience, from R Markdown experts to the Quarto and Shiny curious.
