title: "It's Abstractions All the Way Down..."
author: "JD Long"
abstract: |
    Abstractions rule everything around us. JD Long talks about abstractions from the board room to the silicon.
    
    Over 20 years ago Joel Spolsky famously wrote, "All non-trivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky." Unsurprisingly this has not changed. However, we have introduced more and more layers of abstraction into our workflows: Virtual Machines, AWS services, WASM, Docker, R, Python, data frames, and on and on. But then on top of the computational abstractions we have people abstractions: managers, colleagues, executives, stakeholders, etc.

    JD's presentation will be a wild romp through the mental models of abstractions and discuss how we, as technical analytical types, can gain skill in traversing abstractions and dealing with leaks.

### Notes

<!--- use footnotes as todos --->

-   Organisational hierarchy are abstractions
    -   Silos are leaky abstractions
    -   Data Science type roles break previous organizational abstractions
    -   ![](images/paste-2.png)
-   Debugging abstractions requires seeing (and understanding-ish) below it
-   tl;dr "Head trunk only hold so much junk"
    -   LEARN or PARTNER to deal with abstractions you don't understand
    -   :monocle_face::cool: Bounded Rationality coined by Herbet A. Simon in second edition [Administrative Behavior: a Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Behavior)
-   Good abstractions constrain complexity and separate concerns
-   Wrong metaphors sometimes don't matter, but sometimes they really do
    -   floating point math![^1]
-   multiple abstractions is a high empathy move!!!
    -   give everyone the abstractions they need for the work they are doing![^2]
    -   data products (documentation) are great abstractions for super/guru users

### Q&A

-   put a name on every user personas in small organisations –\> GO ASK THE PERSON!

-   how to protect/keep empathy for the 80%?

    -   maybe they're not your responsibility

    -   don't force people to move up

-   data warehouse, data lake, data lake house...

    -   warehouse – top-down schemas, big cost, low agility

    -   lake - capture and accumulate

    -   lake house - ETL on top of data lakes

-   how leaky do you consider dplyr?
